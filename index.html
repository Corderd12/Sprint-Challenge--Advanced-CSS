      <h2>Connecting Mentors with The Youth</h2>
    
      <p>School in the Cloud is a platform that trains senior volunteers to teach students in a group or individual setting.  This helps kids in communities with high student to teacher ratios. It also provides retired volunteers a sense of purpose and meaning in their day to day life when they find themselves with more free time.  The platform also connects volunteers with the students. The aim is to help close the achievement gap by connecting students with available, qualified volunteer mentors. </p>

      <h3>How it Works</h3>
    
      <p>Seniors who are interested in signing up for the program will do so through our School in The Cloud app.  Seniors can apply on the app.  They will be asked a series of questions that cover a varity of topics related to the School in The Cloud Program. </p>
    
      <p>The questionaire helps identify strengths of volunteers and allows us assign volunteers to kids and communities and designate resources where they are needed the most.</p>

        <h3>Make an Impact in Your Community</h3>

        <p>Mentoring creates positive impact in youthâ€™s lives. Youth with mentors have higher rates of high school graduation and are less likely to drop out of school. They find more self-confidence, self esteem, and are able to create big goals for themselves. Additionally, studies show that behavior, attitudes, and relationships improve when a youth has a mentor. Mentors help children grow and close the social and/or economic opportunity gap</p>
      
        <p>While meeting a student or child once or twice a month may not seem like a huge impact, mentors are creating positive change in the lives of their students. Mentors become someone that youth look up to and trust; and youth may see their own dreams in their mentor. Being a mentor is a rewarding experience that allows us to be the person our younger selves needed.</p>
